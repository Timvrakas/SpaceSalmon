-Test Bus Messaging
-add event timer to sensorTask, to define timing
-make battery/adc threaded
-make squib threaded
-fix assert warnings
-enable ECC ram!

- Some heuristic for sensor health. A way to tell when the sensor is not giving realistic data.
- Some form of error detection, logging and recovery. Explore watchdog timers, an global error code buffer, or something
- Improve performance: Increase SPI clock speed, async SD interface
- I2C stack development: Work on piping the GPS data from the RF carrier, and telemetry to the radio
- Filter Development: used data from logging flight to develop altitude filter
- Flight Management: write code to manage chute deployment etc.


December Launch ToDo:
- SHITL Filter testing
- 100Hz Filter

SHITL:
- Can we ICE in the data?
- Read from SD
    -MCI_OS
    -FatFS_OS

Modify LoggerTask to do both in and out to SD
    -try with different USB cables...

-can be very slow...

Hardware Fixes:
- 2x SPI buses would help performance and code simplicity a lot...


TODO:
Flght time

TODO: Once flight state is "falling" below some velocity, the filter should put a big error on the accel term input, so that it knows when landed.
